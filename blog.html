        <h2>Blog Entry #1</h2>
        <p>Hey all, this week I decided to try out Treehouse's Front End Web Developer tech degree trial. So far it seems well structured and my fellow students/treehouse staff are eager and accomodating to help out.
           It looks as if the program really will give you enough resources to get your first job into the tech industry and support you along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>I am feeling very excited to progress and keep stepping out of my comfort zone.
           One of my biggest challenges I think will be having someone actually look at my code and give me constructive feedback.
           I tend do be critical of myself as it is so that will be quite interesting... I look forward to it though as it will help me grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>Well...that's all I got so far folks! I will try and update this when I can. <strong>Back to the code!</strong></p>
